# Ensemble Attack Network with HiDDeN

## Environmental Setup
```
# git clone https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DeepRobustWatermark
# cd DeepRobustWatermark/
# cd HiDDeN/
```
```
# conda create --name hidden python=3.10
# conda activate hidden
# pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision==0.22.1 torchaudio==2.7.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# pip install -r requirements_hidden.txt
```

## Training
Single-GPU and multi-GPU training. (For multi-GPU training, please refer to [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/basic_tutorials/notebook)).
```
# cd scripts/
# bash train.sh
```

## Evaluation
### Embedding and Decoding Watermarks
```
# cd scripts/
# bash embedding.sh # generate watermarked images and csv file
# bash decoding.sh # extract watermarks and calculate bit accuracy
```
### WAVES Benchmark
For the environmental setup, please refer to [WAVES](https://github.com/umd-huang-lab/WAVES).

Please refer to [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/package_reference/cli) before running the code.

Downolad and put [kl-f16.zip](https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DeepRobustWatermark/releases/tag/kl-f16.zip) under the folder feature_extractors.

```
# git clone https://github.com/XuandongZhao/WatermarkAttacker
# cd WatermarkAttacker/
# pip install -e .
```
```
# cd scripts/
# bash eval_distortion.sh
# bash eval_adversarial.sh
# bash eval_regeneration.sh
```
If you suffer from "ImportError: cannot import name 'VectorQuantizer2". Replace quantize.py on your machine (taming-transformers/taming/modules/vqvae/quantize,py) with this [file](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers/blob/master/taming/modules/vqvae/quantize.py).

### Manipulation Attacks
Using [InstructPix2Pix](https://github.com/timothybrooks/instruct-pix2pix) or [StyleRes](https://github.com/hamzapehlivan/StyleRes) to attack watermarked images generated by ```embedding.sh```. After the attacks, use ```decoding.sh``` to extract watermarks from the distorted images and calculate bit accuracy.

### Pre-trained Weights
